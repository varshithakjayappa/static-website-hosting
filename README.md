# 🌐 Static Website Hosting on AWS using Terraform

A fully automated **static website hosting** setup built with **Terraform** and **AWS**.  
This project provisions an end-to-end infrastructure for hosting a static website (e.g., `thedevlearn.site`) using **S3**, **CloudFront**, **Route53**, and **ACM**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using **Terraform** to deploy a **secure, globally distributed static website** on AWS.  
It includes the following key components:

- **S3 Bucket** – Hosts static website content.
- **CloudFront (CDN)** – Distributes content globally with HTTPS and low latency.
- **Route53** – Manages the custom domain and DNS records.
- **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)** – Provides SSL/TLS certificates for secure HTTPS.
- **Terraform Modules** – Modular design for reusability and clarity.
